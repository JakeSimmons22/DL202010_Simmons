TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btnC relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin

XDCB-2#1 Warning
Clock defined on multiple objects  
The clock sys_clk_pin is defined on multiple objects. Although this is logically functional for timing analysis, it cannot exist in hardware. It is recommended to define a primary clock on a single object.
